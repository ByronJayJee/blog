There is a great blog post from Hugging Face (HF) on the energy use of saying thank you to LLMs.

Background: Sam Altman&rsquo;s Tweet
This whole discussion around being polite to LLMs started as a meme across social media that was eventually mentioned by Sam Altman in a tweet. He mentioned how much money OpenAI had spent but didn&rsquo;t give any energy consumption numbers.


Hugging Face&rsquo;s Analysis
The folks at HF then did their own analysis to estimate the energy usage of saying thank you. And I think they did a great job with their analysis. They even pointed out that their numbers may be an overestimate since they don&rsquo;t have the benefits of &ldquo;economy of scale&rdquo;."><meta name=author content="Byron"><link rel=canonical href=https://byrongaskin.com/blog/posts/llm-thank-you-energy/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/blog/assets/css/stylesheet.8fe10233a706bc87f2e08b3cf97b8bd4c0a80f10675a143675d59212121037c0.css integrity="sha256-j+ECM6cGvIfy4Is8+XuL1MCoDxBnWhQ2ddWSEhIQN8A=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://byrongaskin.com/blog/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://byrongaskin.com/blog/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://byrongaskin.com/blog/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://byrongaskin.com/blog/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://byrongaskin.com/blog/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://byrongaskin.com/blog/posts/llm-thank-you-energy/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style></noscript><script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-7MLXGSG39J"></script><script>var dnt,doNotTrack=!1;if(!1&&(dnt=navigator.doNotTrack||window.doNotTrack||navigator.msDoNotTrack,doNotTrack=dnt=="1"||dnt=="yes"),!doNotTrack){window.dataLayer=window.dataLayer||[];function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments)}gtag("js",new Date),gtag("config","G-7MLXGSG39J")}</script><meta property="og:url" content="https://byrongaskin.com/blog/posts/llm-thank-you-energy/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Byron's thoughts about stuff"><meta property="og:title" content="Saying Thank You to LLMs"><meta property="og:description" content="Introduction There is a great blog post from Hugging Face (HF) on the energy use of saying thank you to LLMs.

And I think they did a great job with their analysis. They even pointed out that their numbers may be an overestimate since they don‚Äôt have the benefits of ‚Äúeconomy of scale‚Äù.\nHF is also not the first group to look into LLM energy usage. In fact, an analysis by EpochAI estimated this type of ChatGPT query to consume about 0.3Wh when using GPT-4o.\nExpanding the Analysis But I think HF‚Äôs blog post could have gone a bit farther:\nI believe the effects of personal habits should be compared to other common personal habits. This HF article compares sending thank you messages (a personal habit) to the total energy used to process all the pleases and thank yous at the data center (a global problem). So I figured I‚Äôd pick up where the article left off.\nComparing Energy Usage to Video Streaming Let‚Äôs give the numbers some context by comparing them to a very common activity: video streaming.\nAccording to an industry report, video streaming may use an average of 200Wh. But even that is not a fair comparison because most of that energy use is by your TV and home internet router.\nThat same industry report estimates that datacenter energy usage due to video streaming is about 1Wh (which is only 0.5% of the total energy cost of streaming).\nOkay okay, but now we have a number (1Wh for 1 hour of video streaming) that we can fairly compare to HF‚Äôs values.\nEnergy Consumption Table Here‚Äôs a table showing the energy consumption values from HF‚Äôs analysis of the llama-8b model and EpochAI‚Äôs ChatGPT GPT-4o analysis, compared to the number of minutes of video streaming needed for the same amount of datacenter power draw:\nAnalysis Energy Consumption per Thank You (W) Equivalent Minutes of Video Streaming Hugging Face 0.245 14.7 EpochAI 0.3 18 Key Takeaways According to Netflix‚Äôs most recent ESG report (the 2023 report at the time of writing this blog post), their platform streams about 1 hour per day per account (there must be a lot of abandoned accounts). And a report by Reviews.org found the average American watches 3.5 hours of streaming per day.\nHere are my thoughts:\nsaying thank you has much less datacenter energy use than the average person‚Äôs streaming usage. we should keep saying thank you, it is a habit that makes us human. And we can easily make up for that extra energy use by reducing our use somewhere else (like 15min fewer minutes of streaming per day or turning off autoplay). saying thank you also won‚Äôt hurt if the robots finally do have an uprising üòÇ. Final Thoughts Seriously tho, I believe that LLM providers should be releasing our energy usage and carbon footprint metrics. Posts and analyses like this are fun BUT it‚Äôs kinda frustrating knowing that all the big providers most likely already have this information available to them.\nTL;DR Going based on the numbers in the article:\nsaying thank you uses about the same amount of datacenter energy as 15 minutes of video streaming. The average person in the US streams over 3 hours of video per day. Conclusion: I suggest we probably say thank you more and stream videos less.\n","wordCount":"618","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-06-16T19:12:31-04:00","dateModified":"2025-06-16T19:12:31-04:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Byron"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://byrongaskin.com/blog/posts/llm-thank-you-energy/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Byron's thoughts about stuff","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://byrongaskin.com/blog/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://byrongaskin.com/blog/ accesskey=h title="Byron's thoughts about stuff (Alt + H)">Byron's thoughts about stuff</a><div class=logo-switches></div></div><ul id=menu></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Saying Thank You to LLMs</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2025-06-16 19:12:31 -0400 EDT'>June 16, 2025</span>&nbsp;¬∑&nbsp;3 min&nbsp;¬∑&nbsp;Byron</div></header><div class=post-content><h2 id=introduction>Introduction<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#introduction>#</a></h2><p>There is a great <a href=https://huggingface.co/blog/jdelavande/thank-you-energy>blog post</a> from Hugging Face (HF) on the energy use of saying thank you to LLMs.</p><hr><h2 id=background-sam-altmans-tweet>Background: Sam Altman&rsquo;s Tweet<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#background-sam-altmans-tweet>#</a></h2><p>This whole discussion around being polite to LLMs started as a meme across social media that was eventually mentioned by Sam Altman in a tweet.
