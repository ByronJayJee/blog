Well...this is awkward. 

I'm excited to finally start a blog but I have no idea where to begin or what to post. 

Hopefully, my personal blog will become a log of insightful (and maybe rambly) entries about data, mathematics, technology, and the interactions that each of those topics have with society.

...but for now, let's just start with one of my favorite jokes:
